# Introduction

Welcome to **Layer**, the platform that transforms your product documentation into **AI-powered chat assistants**. With Layer, your developers no longer have to sift through heaps of documentation.

Layer enables you to **deploy LLM extensions** to multiple locations, including a **chat widget** on your documentation site, **VS Code**, **GitHub Copilot**, and more. These integrations provide real-time, relevant support, helping your developers integrate your product more efficiently.
