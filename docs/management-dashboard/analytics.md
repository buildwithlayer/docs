# Analytics

The **Analytics** page provides insights into how users are interacting with your MCP server. This helps you understand which parts of your product are being used the most and by how many users.

Currently, the dashboard includes:

- **Tool Usage**: See which tools have been called, how frequently, their HTTP response status codes, and the MCP client used to call them.
- **Unique Users**: Track the number of distinct users who have interacted with your MCP server.

:::note

The MCP protocol does not currently support logging raw user queries, so Layer’s analytics are based only on structured interactions—such as tool calls. As the protocol and clients evolve, Layer will expand analytics coverage to include more granular interaction data.

These metrics can help you identify which features are most in demand, what’s resonating with users, and where to focus future improvements.
